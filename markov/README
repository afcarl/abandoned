markov

## ABOUT

A Markov chain text-generation algorithm in a variety of programming languages.
Implemented per chapter 3 of "The Practice of Programming" by Brian Kernighan
and Rob Pike.

Currently, implementations are available in the following languages:

- C
- Go
- Python
- Java


## BUILD

C:      gcc -o markov markov.c
Go:     go build markov.go
Python: N/A
Java:   javac Markov.java


## USAGE

The program needs to be "trained" with some sample text; two examples,
iliad.txt and psalms.txt are provided.

Each program reads text from standard input and writes to standard output.
If you want to train from a file or redirect output to a file, use pipes.

To specify the number of words of generated text, provide an integer as a
command-line argument.

Example:
    ./markov 500 < iliad.txt > foo.txt

This trains on iliad.txt, generates 500 words of text, and writes to foo.txt.


## AUTHOR

Except for the C implementation, which is copied with few changes from TPOP,
these programs were written by Daniel Connelly.  You can find my stuff at
