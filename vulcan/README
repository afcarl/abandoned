vulcan

# ABOUT

Vulcan is a small, dynamic programming language that compiles to JavaScript.
Its syntax is similar to Python and Ruby but its semantics are stricter.  It
exists as an exercise in language design and compiler construction.

For a simple example, see the file `example.vn`.

# STATUS

Vulcan is currently in active development.  The following components are
implemented:

- an LL(2) recursive-descent parser that emits an abstract syntax tree.

# DEPENDENCIES

The only dependency is Python 2.7.

# USAGE

Currently, only the parser is implemented.  You can run it as a program that
displays a prompt and pretty-prints the AST of the parsed input by running 
`python parser.py`.  You can also provide a file name argument to
pretty-print the AST of a separate program:

    python parser.py example.vn

# TODO

See the TODO file for the current project plan.
